"""Workflow catalog: what ``POST /api/workflows/{name}/run`` REALLY executes.

Honesty rules this file enforces (see tests/test_workflow_truth.py):
- Every entry in ``WORKFLOW_CATALOG`` is executable through the API
  (``api_executable: True``) and declares ``implementation_status:
  "implemented"``. There is no ``partial`` and no ``descriptive`` entry: a
  concept without an execution route does not belong in a list that a screen
  renders as "ejecutable".
- ``steps`` are the steps THIS endpoint executes. ``pipeline_steps`` (when
  present) are the broader stages of the service or scheduled job it delegates
  to; they are not steps of ``/run`` and are labelled as such.
- Anything with no API route lives in ``RETIRED_WORKFLOWS`` with the reason and
  the real replacement, and disappears from ``GET /api/workflows``.
