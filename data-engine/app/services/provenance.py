"""Provenance envelope for every surfaced datum.

Product standard: no surfaced datum without real provenance, freshness and
coverage state; missing or delayed data is explicit, never filled.

- official:   regulator/official statistics body (SEC, CNMV, FRED, ECB, Eurostat)
- issuer:     published by the company itself (IR pages, press releases)
- exchange:   provided by a trading venue
- unofficial: aggregators / unofficial APIs (Yahoo, stooq) — never authoritative
