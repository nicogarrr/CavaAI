"""Claim scoping: which claims belong to the thesis being read.

Claims are created per ``ThesisVersion`` (``_persist_claims`` writes a fresh
Claim row for every generation), but five consumers read them by
``company_id`` alone: the thesis dependency graph, the red team, the moat
assessment, the company chat, and claim matching.

The consequences were concrete:

* every regeneration added ~5 orphaned claims from the previous version, and
  ``red_team_score`` fell monotonically with each one. A claim with
  ``materiality_score >= 7`` and no evidence costs 8 points, so three
  regenerations drove a healthy company to 0/100. The score was a function of
  how many times the thesis had been regenerated, not of the risk.
* the graph put a node per stale claim into the CURRENT version;
* the chat cited claims that no longer belonged to the thesis it was answering
  about;
* ``match_claims`` returned superseded claims and ``apply_suggestion`` then
  mutated their status in place, so a document could "contradict" a claim from
  a thesis that had been superseded months earlier.

This module centralises the rule so the five call sites cannot drift apart
again.
