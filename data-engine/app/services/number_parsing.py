"""Locale-aware number parsing for financial amounts.

One parser, one set of rules, used by every ingestion path. The previous state
of the codebase had three independent implementations, and two of them stripped
every comma, which is wrong for a product that reads Spanish-language filings
(CNMV, ESEF) and Spanish-locale broker exports:

* ``"0,24"``  -> ``24``     (100x)
* ``"1.234,56"`` -> ``1.23456``  (1000x)

and the validation in those paths agreed the Spanish form was well formed, so
the corruption was persisted.

Rules
-----
* both separators present: the LAST one is the decimal separator
  (``1.234,56`` and ``1,234.56`` both mean 1234.56)
* a single separator followed by 1-2 digits is a decimal separator (``0,24``)
* a single separator followed by exactly 3 digits is a thousands separator
  (``1,234`` and ``1.250``), and a repeated separator is grouping
  (``1.234.567``); without this, ``(1.250)`` thousand became -1.25 instead of
  -1.250.000 and es-ES grouping was rejected outright
* parentheses around the whole token mean negative (accounting notation)
* non-breaking and regular spaces are thousands separators
