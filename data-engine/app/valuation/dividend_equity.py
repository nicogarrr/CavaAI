"""Pure dividend-discount (DDM) and free-cash-flow-to-equity (FCFE) primitives.

No DB, no company, no engine: every function here is a function of its
arguments, so a test can check the formula against a value computed by hand
instead of against the module's own output.

Why a module of its own
-----------------------

**FCFE already IS the equity value.** ``FCFE`` is cash flow *after* interest,
*after* net borrowing and *after* the reinvestment the payout policy dictates,
so the present value of the FCFE stream is the value of the **equity**
directly. Subtracting net debt from it is the classic double count: the debt
was already paid out of the flow (``Δdebt`` enters the bridge) and is already
in the ``ke`` discount rate. ``run_fcfe`` therefore returns
``equity_value`` and never accepts a net-debt bridge at all; it accepts
``total_debt`` only as a disclosure, and
``reconcile_fcfe_against_dividend_model`` proves the point: with retention
``b = 0``, ``Δdebt = 0`` and ``ΔWC = 0`` the FCFE value collapses exactly onto
``D1/(ke - g)``, the Gordon price.

The arithmetic the module is built around
-----------------------------------------

In a permanent regime the Gordon growth model is

    P = D1 / (ke - g)                                              (1)

and the earnings side of the *same* statement is the justified forward P/E

    P/E1 = payout / (ke - g)   , valid only while g = ROE * (1 - payout)  (2)

(2) is not a free-standing valuation: it is (1) rewritten. With book value
growing at ``g`` (``g = ROE * (1 - payout)``), ``EPS1 = BV1 * ROE`` and
``BV1 = EPS1 / (ROE * (1 + g))`` give

    P = BV1 * (ROE - g)/(ke - g)
      = EPS1 * (ROE - g)/ROE / ((1 + g) * (ke - g))
      = EPS1 * payout / (ke - g)                                   (3)

using ``payout = 1 - g/ROE = (ROE - g)/ROE``. So (1) and (3) are the same
number, and the two ways disagree **only** when the observed dividend is not
``EPS1 * payout`` (a company paying out more or less than its policy) or when
``g > ROE`` (which no firm can do: growing the equity base faster than the
return on it is arithmetically impossible).

That disagreement is the product of this module. ``reconcile_dividend_model``
returns both legs, the residual, and the growth that *would* reconcile them,
so "my DDM says 30.90" can be audited into "my DDM says 30.90 because the
dividend is 1.80 growing 3% against a 9% ke (D1 = 1.854, P = 30.90) — and the
company's verifiable 60% payout on 3.00 EPS (EPS1 = 3.09, P = 30.90) agrees
exactly, because D0 = EPS * payout. If the observed dividend were 1.50 instead,
the gap would be the dividend policy, not the discount rate".

Clamps
------

``ke - g`` is the whole model, so it is never repaired by clamping. ``ke <= g``
is refused, not fixed: the alternative is a perpetuity whose price is
infinite, negative, or a division by a number near zero, and all three are
numbers a reader would take seriously. What *is* clamped is the growth
assumption itself, which is a policy guess:

* ``d1`` (explicit-stage dividend growth) to ``[-0.10, +0.25]`` — above 25% a
  "dividend" is a new issue, and below -10% the company is cutting.
* ``g2`` (perpetual dividend growth) to a ``0.05`` ceiling — no perpetuity
  grows faster than long-run nominal GDP forever, and the floor is a
  dividend cut, not a decline. Every clamp applied is returned in the trace.
