"""Pure relative-multiples primitives: derive, rank, and apply peer multiples.

No DB. The engine resolves the peer set and the peer fundamentals; everything
here is arithmetic on numbers the caller already has, so a test can check a
median and a percentile against values computed by hand.

The three multipliers that decide a screening
--------------------------------------------

A relative multiple is a statement of the form *"this company should trade
where its peers trade, on the same fundamental"*. Three things have to be true
for that statement to mean anything, and each one is a way the method lies:

1. **The peer set was not chosen backwards.** Any peer set can be made to
   "justify" a price: pick the peers that agree and the multiple becomes proof.
   So the peer set's provenance travels with the answer
   (``peer_set_source``) and its size is published (``peer_set_size``) rather
   than presented as "the sector".
2. **The multiple means something.** ``P/E`` on a loss-making company is a
   negative ratio, not a cheap share: a −20x P/E is not a bargain, it is the
   absence of the denominator. Those multiples are returned as ``None`` with a
   reason, never as a number.
3. **The median of five points is not a statistic.** With ``n < 5`` the median
   is one observation's luck. It is still reported — the alternative is
   refusing every small-cap screen there is — but it is labelled, and the
   label travels into ``publication_blockers``.

Formulas, and why they are the ones already in the codebase
------------------------------------------------------------

``pe = price / eps`` and ``ev_to_x = (price * shares + debt - cash) / x`` are
the formulas ``HistoricalValuationService`` already uses per year
(``app/services/historical_valuation_service.py``: ``"pe": self._divide(price, eps)``,
``"ev_to_fcf": self._divide(enterprise_value, fcf)``). They are re-declared here
as pure functions rather than imported so the module stays DB-free, and
``tests/test_relative_multiples_engine.py`` asserts that the two agree on the
same inputs, so this is a *shared* primitive and not a second opinion.
``ev_to_ebitda`` follows the same shape with ``ebitda`` in the denominator, and
``p_to_fcf = price / fcf_per_share`` is the equity-side of ``ev_to_fcf``
(``equity_value = EV - net_debt``, so they differ by exactly the leverage).

Percentiles
-----------

Linear interpolation between order statistics, identical to
``HistoricalValuationService._percentile`` (``quantile * (n-1)`` with linear
weighting) so a percentile read here and a percentile read from the historical
chart are the same number.
