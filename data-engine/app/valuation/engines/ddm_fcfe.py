"""Dividend-discount (DDM) and free-cash-flow-to-equity (FCFE) engines.

Both are *equity methods*: they discount cash flow that is already after
interest, so their present value **is** the equity value and net debt is never
subtracted. The arithmetic, the clamps, the identity between the two legs and
the edge cases all live in ``app/valuation/dividend_equity.py``; this module
only resolves facts, picks the method, and publishes the trace.

Contracts (FinancialFact metric names)
--------------------------------------

DDM (``DividendDiscountEngine``):

===============================  ==============================================
``dividend_per_share``           required. D0, last declared annual dividend.
``cost_of_equity``               strongly preferred; falls back to the tag WACC
                                 with ``cost_of_equity_source=tag_default``.
``dividend_growth``              d1 and g2 (a single explicit assumption).
``book_value_growth``            alias for the above when no dividend growth.
``eps`` / ``eps_diluted``        needed only for the justified-P/E leg.
``net_income``                   alias path for eps when no EPS fact exists.
``payout_ratio``                 needed for the justified-P/E leg.
``roe`` / ``return_on_equity``   enables the ``g <= ROE`` refusal.
``shares_diluted``               required.
``dividend_forecast_years``      n1. Policy default 3, declared in the trace.
===============================  ==============================================

FCFE (``FreeCashFlowToEquityEngine``) adds:

===========================  =================================================
``net_income``               required.
``capex`` / ``capital_expenditure``   required. Signs are normalised to an
                             outflow magnitude and the normalisation is
                             published, because the two are subtracted from each
                             other and a mixed convention inverts the term.
``depreciation_amortization``  required.
``delta_total_debt``         required (or ``total_debt`` + ``total_debt_prior_period``).
``delta_working_capital``    required (or ``working_capital`` + its prior period).
``retention_ratio``          b. Or derived from ``payout_ratio`` as 1 - payout.
===========================  =================================================

Refusals, each with a named ``missing_inputs`` entry
---------------------------------------------------

* No dividend and no verifiable payout → ``insufficient_data``. A dividend
  discount model on a company that pays no dividend is an invention.
* ``ke <= g`` → ``cost_of_equity_above_dividend_growth`` (the perpetuity is
  infinite or negative; clamping the spread would invent a price).
* ``ke <= -1`` → ``cost_of_equity_above_minus_one`` (discount factors
  alternate in sign, so they are not a discount).
* ``g >= roe`` → ``growth_below_return_on_equity`` (the equity base cannot
  compound faster than its own return; dividing by the difference is how these
  models end up quoting 400x multiples as information).
* ``payout > 105%`` sustained → ``payout_ratio_not_above_one``.
* ``shares_diluted <= 0`` → ``positive_shares_diluted``.
* An ADR with no ``adr:N`` ratio → ``adr_ratio``, same refusal as the FCFF DCF.

Publication blockers
--------------------

``dividend_growth_source``   the growth was a tag default, not a fact.
``cost_of_equity_source``    ``ke`` was a tag default, not a sourced fact.
``payout_ratio_source``      the payout was derived, not verifiable.
``forecast_is_not_the_driver``  terminal value > 95% of the value (reusing the
                             FCFF token: the explicit stage is a formality).
