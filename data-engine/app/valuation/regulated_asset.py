"""Pure regulated-asset (DASR) primitives for rate-regulated utilities.

No DB, no company, no engine. Everything below is a function of its arguments
so a test can check the identity with a hand calculation.

The framework and its derivation
--------------------------------

A rate-regulated utility is paid ``allowed_roe`` on a **regulatory rate base**
by a regulator, not a customer, so its earnings are a *function of the rate
base*, not of a demand curve. In permanent equilibrium:

* the regulator lets the company earn ``E = RB * allowed_roe`` on the
  **invested claim** ``B`` (see ``ALLOWED_ROE_CONVENTIONS`` for what ``B`` is:
  the whole base, or only its equity slice);
* the base is financed ``equity_ratio`` equity / ``(1 - equity_ratio)`` debt,
  so the *enterprise* capital requirement of the base is ``RB`` itself and the
  equity slice is ``RB * equity_ratio``; equivalently the enterprise capital
  requirement per unit of equity is ``1 / equity_ratio``. Writing ``EV`` for
  the enterprise requirement and ``Equity`` for the market value of the equity
  slice::

      EV  = RB / equity_ratio
      Equity = EV * equity_ratio = RB

  i.e. **the equity market value is not the book equity**: it is the book
  equity ``B`` plus the present value of the economic profit the allowed
  return earns over the cost of that equity;
* economic profit in period ``t`` is ``EP_t = (allowed_roe - ke) * B_{t-1}``,
  so with ``B`` growing at ``g``::

      V = B + Σ_{t>=1} EP_t / (1+ke)^t
        = B + (allowed_roe - ke) * B / (ke - g)                     (E)
        = B * (1 + (allowed_roe - ke) / (ke - g))

  At ``g = 0`` this collapses to ``B * allowed_roe / ke``, which is the
  "earnings capitalised at the cost of equity" form the utility literature
  quotes. **Both are the same statement**; (E) is the general one and the
  reader gets the ``g = 0`` special case in the trace.

**The convention is worth a factor of ``equity_ratio``.** Under
``whole_rate_base`` (``B = RB``) and ``equity_slice``
(``B = RB * equity_ratio``) the identity (E) is linear in ``B``, so the two
readings of the same rate case differ by exactly ``equity_ratio`` — two to
three times for a typical utility. The convention is therefore a required,
published input (``ALLOWED_ROE_CONVENTIONS``,
``CONVENTION_VALUE_RATIO_NOTE``) and is never inferred from the data.

The dividend cross-check
------------------------

The same equity value has to be reachable from the dividend, because that is
how the value is actually distributed: ``V = D1 / (ke - g)`` with
``D1 = B * allowed_roe * payout * (1 + g)``. Setting (E) equal to that gives

    payout = (allowed_roe - g) / (allowed_roe * (1 + g))               (P)

which at ``g = 0`` is ``payout = 1`` and, to first order, is the familiar
sustainable-growth condition ``g = (1 - payout) * allowed_roe``. ``P`` is
*not* an assumption to be satisfied: it is a diagnostic. A utility paying 70%
with a 2% allowed-ROE growth assumption is mis-modelled by exactly the
difference, and ``reconcile_regulated_asset_model`` returns that difference
instead of hiding it inside a single number.

The two legs also answer "why is the excess-return value the headline": the
dividend leg prices the payout policy and drops the retained earnings that
fund the rate base the value is supposed to grow with, so it is systematically
*different* from (E) unless (P) holds. Both are returned, reconciled, and the
residual is published.

The earning-power shortfall
---------------------------

The company earns ``allowed_roe`` on the **regulatory** base, never on its
accounting one. The whole reason a rate-case model exists is the gap between
the two: a company whose book equity is 40% of its rate base is levered
against a regulated return, and a company that books regulatory assets at
cost reports an accounting ROE unrelated to what the regulator actually
allows. ``earning_power_shortfall`` returns, term by term, the allowed
earnings, the reported earnings, and the difference — the product of the
engine, not a footnote.

Edge cases this module refuses instead of repairing
----------------------------------------------------

* ``allowed_roe < ke``: the regulated return does not cover the cost of the
  equity the base is financed with. The correct answer is a **negative** equity
  value (the base destroys the capital invested in it). The module returns it
  negative and flags it; it does not clamp to zero, because a zero would
  assert "worth exactly nothing" where the arithmetic says "worth less than
  the equity in it".
* ``equity_ratio`` outside ``(0, 1]``: not a capital structure.
* ``capex > depreciation`` while the rate base is frozen: the company is
  investing into a base the regulator is not letting it earn on. Value does
  not stagnate by accident — it stagnates *arithmetically*, because the model
  has no growth in the base. That is the warning this engine exists to raise.
