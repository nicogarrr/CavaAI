"""Single-use nonce store for the signed identity bridge (anti-replay).

Every bound signature carries a random nonce that must be consumed exactly
once. Storage is Redis ``SET NX EX`` (atomic check-and-mark with TTL).

Availability posture: when Redis is unreachable the store may degrade to a
process-local TTL cache so a Redis outage does not become an auth outage —
but ONLY outside production (local/test). In production the store fails
closed with :class:`NonceBackendUnavailable` (HTTP 503 at the caller, like
the rate limiter), because the local cache only blocks replays seen by THIS
process and the single-use guarantee would silently weaken.
