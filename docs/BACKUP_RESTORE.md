# Backup and Restore Runbook

Create a PostgreSQL backup:

```powershell
.\scripts\backup.ps1
```

Include consistent snapshots of MongoDB, Qdrant and MinIO volumes (the script briefly stops those storage services):

```powershell
.\scripts\backup.ps1 -IncludeStorageVolumes
```

Restore only during a maintenance window. The restore command requires an explicit destructive-operation switch and accepts only a backup path inside the workspace:

```powershell
.\scripts\restore.ps1 -BackupPath .\backups\YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS -ConfirmRestore
```

After restore, run `docker compose run --rm backend alembic upgrade head`, verify `/health/ready`, compare tenant/document/position counts with the backup manifest, open one stored document, and execute a read-only company snapshot. Production backups should be copied to encrypted storage outside the Docker host and tested with a quarterly restore drill.
